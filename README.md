# CMakeFilesBoilerPlate


This is a simple program to quickly generate  "CMakeFiles.txt" boilerplate.

Its mostly for personal use, but i don't see a reason not to share it on GitHub.

The program is written in C++ and can be compiled with:

Linux:

    g++ main.cpp -o CMakeFilesBoilerPlate
   
   Windows: 
   

    g++ main.cpp -o CMakeFilesBoilerPlate.exe
   
   (Requires C++17+ compatible compiler)
